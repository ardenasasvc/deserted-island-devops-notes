# KEYNOTE: Bridge Construction Kit: DevOps and Security Don't Have to Be Islands

- Ian Coldwater (Lead Platform Security Engineer @ Heroku) | @IanColdwater

## General Notes

- Their username is a SQL injection string (lol)

## Root Cause Analysis

- DevOps and security (teams) are often at odds, but they don't have to be
	- "Silos are for grain"
- Security potentially sees devs as "moving fast and breaking things"
- Developers potentially see security teams as something that slow them down
	- Most developers (on all teams) want to do well, they just have a lot going on

### Fixes

- Approach other teams/people with empathy
- Good communication takes practice
- DevOps is about continuous improvement, focus on continually improving your communication skills
- Create, discuss, and share blameless postmortems
