# KEYNOTE: Bridge Construction Kit: DevOps and Security Don't Have to Be Islands

Ian Coldwater (Lead Platform Security Engineer @ Heroku) | @IanColdwater

## General Notes

- Their username is a SQL injection string (lol)
- "Security isn't a blocker. It's integral."
- We are all on the same team working toward the same goals
	- We can do better, by ourselves and with each other
- Sounds like Heroku (at least Ian's team) has a really good developer culture with healthy inter-team communication

## Root Cause Analysis

- DevOps and security (teams) are often at odds, but they don't have to be
	- "Silos are for grain"
- Security potentially sees devs as "moving fast and breaking things"
- Developers potentially see security teams as something that slow them down
	- Most developers (on all teams) want to do well, they just have a lot going on

### Fixes for Poor Communication

- Approach other teams/people with empathy
- Good communication takes practice
- DevOps is about continuous improvement, focus on continually improving your communication skills
- Create, discuss, and share blameless postmortems
- Document as you go; make it a priority
- Strive to get teams thinking/communicating on the same page
- "Chop trees, carry water" - Kubernetes Community
	- Put in work
	- Do things together, for each other
	- Be humble
- Understand that not everyone thinks like you
	- DevOps people:
		- Understand that not everyone wants to quickly slap together software that works quickly but has super open/insecure defaults
		- Loop security in during development
	- Security people:
		- Keep up with the latest trends/technology so you can understand what's being built and
		- Try not to be "the Team of No" (learn to talk to people on their level and have conversations instead of just vetoing things)
- Don't be afraid to shake things up or speak up
	- Breaking down walls doesn't happen silently
