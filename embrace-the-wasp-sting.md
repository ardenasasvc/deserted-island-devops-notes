# [Embrace the Wasp Sting: Why Failure Helps Your Team](https://desertedisland.club/agenda/#adriennetacke)

## General Notes

- What do we fear?
	- Failure is our biggest fear (broken builds, breaking production, being the one at fault)
- Why do we fear failure?
	- It's not pleasant (brings shame, embarrassment, etc.)
	- It feels like a blow to our professionalism
	- Can heighten the feeling of imposter syndrome
	- Can be costly on a money level
		- e.g. An unnamed casino that was saving credit card numbers in plaintext and was fined $250,000,000
- Failure is a chance to collaborate
	- Adrienne didn't know your swollen wasp eye in Animal Crossing would heal with time/medicine until one of her villagers informed her
