# [Embrace the Wasp Sting: Why Failure Helps Your Team](https://desertedisland.club/agenda/#adriennetacke)

Adrienne Tacke (Senior Developer Advocate @ MongoDB) | @AdrienneTacke

## Abstract

It's every developer's worst fearâ€¦breaking the build! Or worse, bringing down prod!

Much like getting that first wasp sting (especially as a new Animal Crossing player), our first instinct when encountering failure is to run away from it and potentially change our behavior to avoid repeating our mistake!

In this talk, however, I'd like to talk about why that failure is important and how, if given the right environment, it can be the most valuable learning opportunity for all people involved!

Specifically, I'll discuss:

How certain things can only be learned after a failure (like the fact that you can make your own medicine with the wasp nest!)
How others can help us when we discover a failure point (much like villagers helping us out with some free medicine!)
How fostering a psychologically safe environment to fail positively impacts a team (much like discovering the "worst" penalty for being stung twice in a row is a swollen eye and a trip back to your home!)
By the end of this talk, I hope that you'll leave with a new outlook on failure and begin embracing the possible learning opportunities that await your team!

## General Notes

- What do we fear?
	- Failure is our biggest fear (broken builds, breaking production, being the one at fault)
- Why do we fear failure?
	- It's not pleasant (brings shame, embarrassment, etc.)
	- It feels like a blow to our professionalism
	- Can heighten the feeling of imposter syndrome
	- Can be costly on a money level
		- e.g. An unnamed casino that was saving credit card numbers in plaintext and was fined $250,000,000
- Failure is a chance to collaborate
	- Adrienne didn't know your swollen wasp eye in Animal Crossing would heal with time/medicine until one of her villagers informed her
