# If You Can Wait 6 Months, You Should

## General Notes

- They like Animaniacs
- They coordinated their IRL outfit with their in-game one and they were sad the Zoom call wasn't broadcast so people could see
- "If You Can Wait 6 Months, You Should"
	- This phrase is meant to discuss infra and ops concerns, not giving advice to startups (lol)
- "Animal Crossing encourages you to wait, take a little more time, and be patient"
- DevOps pushes things out so fast and it's so tempting to jump in and start using things quickly
	- If you can, it's worth it to wait six months before trying a new, emerging technology
- Try to be wary of too much abstraction
	- Abstraction can often introduce/trade complexity in unexpected ways
- They used the robot in Animal Crossing as an example for good things you have to wait/work for instead of getting instant gratification
- Some times there are enough benefits to an emerging technology that it's worth rolling some of your own solutions while you wait for the community to finish putting together the final implementation of something that hits all your use cases
