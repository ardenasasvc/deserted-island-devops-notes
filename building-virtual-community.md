# Building Virtual Community

## General Notes

- A lot of us currently feel like we're on a deserted island (thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic)
- Community proves a means for people connected by common need, geography, or interest
	- Allows members to share knowledge/empathy
- Community building is led by individuals, not brands
	- Trust is crucial to building a strong community and it's easier to trust an individual than a faceless organization
- It's your place as a community manager to make sure members of your community are getting value out
	- How does your community provide value?
	- How can you replicate that value in a digital medium to continue your community during the pandemic?
		- Understand that things will be different, but that doesn't mean things will be worse (often things will be better)

# Creating a Community

1. Find an opportunity for a community
	- Look for a gap where you wish there was a community but you can't find one
1. Partner with 1-2 folk
1. Welcome collaboration
	- Don't just build a community for yourself
1. Request iteration and feedback
