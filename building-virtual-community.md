# Building Virtual Community

## General Notes

- A lot of us currently feel like we're on a deserted island (thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic)
- Community proves a means for people connected by common need, geography, or interest
	- Allows members to share knowledge/empathy
- Community building is led by individuals, not brands
	- Trust is crucial to building a strong community and it's easier to trust an individual than a faceless organization
- It's your place as a community manager to make sure members of your community are getting value out
	- How does your community provide value?
	- How can you replicate that value in a digital medium to continue your community during the pandemic?
		- Understand that things will be different, but that doesn't mean things will be worse (often things will be better)
- Choose your community platform and tools consciously
- Avoid forcing people to learn a new tool to use your community
	- Don't give in to the "shiny toy" syndrome
- Try not to move your community between tools multiple times
- You get what you give in a community

## Creating a Community

### Getting Started

1. Find an opportunity for a community
	- Look for a gap where you wish there was a community but you can't find one
1. Partner with 1-2 folk
1. Welcome collaboration
	- Don't just build a community for yourself
1. Request iteration and feedback

### Maintaining the Community

1. Create a code of conduct with
1. Use inclusive, welcoming language on your public-facing text
1. Value the community's input but have some final decision makers
1. Keep an eye out for bad actors and enforce the code of conduct

### Be a Good Citizen

- Follow the rules
- Assume the best in people (default to empathy)
- Show effort
- Celebrate successes
- Give to others freely
	- "All gifts must be given without strings attached"

## Q&A

- How to make virtual communication more human?
	- Try to clarify what you're saying so it can't be misconstrued
	- In text communication, emoji help convey tone
- Tips for building communities in a corporate context?
	- Try to bridge gaps between teams and talk to people outside of your area/school of thought
- "How do you deal with 'social burnout'. I notice that every time I've been a mod/community leader in a digital community, the checking of the community posts felt like a chore really fast, which I rarely have as a 'normal user'. I think it has to do with the expectation to always be 'on' as a community organiser. Do you recognise this? And do you have tips to deal with it?"
	- Have more people that help with moderating
	- You don't need 24/7 moderation
	- There's a chance building a community might not be "for you"
		- Maybe you instead want to be an active community member instead
