# Mob Programming From Home: A Case Study in Teaching Cloud Migration From YOUR Island Getaway

## General Notes

- They're solving onboarding of new developers via virtual mob programming
- Mob programming is when you have a bunch of people working together simultaneously on the same work at one computer with a rotational mechanic to allow multiple people to "drive" and get hands-on experience
- Switch drivers frequently
	- Set an alarm so you don't get sucked into debugging one problem
- Remotely, do one hour driver windows
	- In person, 15-20 minutes is suggested

## Q&A

- Is there a sweet spot in regards to how many people should be involved in mob programming?
	- Small enough that people don't check out between rotations in the "active" roles of driver/navigators (probably 6-9)
- How do you handle the logistics in the remote mob programming call? What happens if everyone starts talking over each other? How do you make sure the quieter person in the room gets a word in?
	- Mute everyone. Have folks raise their hands when they want to talk. Or let everyone talk and have the quieter folks raising their hands trigger a mass mute.
