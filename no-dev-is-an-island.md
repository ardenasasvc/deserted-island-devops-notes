# No Dev is an Island: How to do serverless together

Noƒçnica Fee (Developer Advocate @ New Relic) | @nocnicafee

## General Notes

- Goes by Nica as well
- They work on serverless monitoring
- Serverless isn't a technology, it's "just a concept for who handles what"
- "0% of managers like explaining your AWS bill"
	- Try not to surprise your manager with your server bill at the end of the month; give them a heads up
	- You can't 1:1 simulate serverless on your laptop which mandates expenses
- "Document the why" of your stack

# "Serverless is hard for teams, like, actually surprisingly hard"

- IAM security roles are hard to manage/onboard
- "Testing is nonexistent"
